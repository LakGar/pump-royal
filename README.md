# Pump Royal

Pump Royal is a Web3-based fitness app that gamifies physical activity through staking and rewards. Inspired by BeReal, but with a fitness twist, users stake into a game where they are prompted to complete a physical challenge. Completing the challenge allows them to reclaim their stake, while failure results in their stake being added to a loser pool. This pool is then distributed among 10 lucky winners, making the potential rewards huge with a high number of participants.

## How It Works
1. **Join the Game** – Stake a set amount to enter a challenge.
2. **Complete the Challenge** – Perform the required physical activity within the given timeframe.
3. **Win or Lose** – If you succeed, you get your stake back. If you fail, your stake is added to the loser pool.
4. **Big Rewards** – The loser pool is distributed among 10 lucky winners, increasing the incentive for participation.
